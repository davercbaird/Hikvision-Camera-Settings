# Hikvision-Camera-Settings

Language: VB.NET

Tool to connect and modify Hikvision camera "Motion Detection Settings".  

This application will connect to your Hikvision camera and allow you to easily enable or disable motion detection for up to 8 cameras.

The motivation for this stems from the following scenario:

When you enable email alerts based on motion detection directly in the camera it's always annoying when you are at home and constantly getting motion detection emails. I envisioned this as a simple way to enable or disable motion alerts.


I have tested this on the following camera: DS-2CD2332-I, V5.4.5 build 170123 but should work on other models.  I can't guarantee this to work on any other camera or firmware version.

How to use:

Run the Hikvision-Camera-Settings.exe

Enter your camera IP address, Username, and Password.

Click Connect to retrieve “Motion Enabled” status
